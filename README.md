## 🚀 Feature Breakdown

This project is designed to simulate a real-world property rental platform. Below is a breakdown of the core features implemented or planned:

- **👤 User Management**
  - Supports multiple user roles:
    - Customers (can browse, book, and review properties)
    - Hotel/Property Managers (can list and manage their properties)
    - Administrators (manage users, listings, and platform settings)
  - Secure authentication and authorization
  - User profile management

- **🏠 Property Management**
  - Property owners can:
    - Add new property listings
    - Provide detailed descriptions (location, rooms, amenities, images, etc.)
    - Edit or delete existing listings
  - Customers can:
    - Browse all available listings
    - Filter/search by location, price, or features

- **📅 Booking System**
  - Customers can:
    - Select preferred dates
    - Make bookings for available properties
    - View booking history and status
  - Prevents double-booking and overlapping reservations

- **💳 Payment Integration**
  - Customers can:
    - Pay for bookings via integrated payment gateway
    - View transaction status (successful, pending, failed)
  - Secure handling of sensitive payment data (e.g., via Stripe or other gateways)
  - Payment confirmation tied to booking status

Each feature is modularly designed to ensure easy scalability and maintainability as the project evolves.


## 🔐 API Security

Ensuring secure access to the API is a top priority in this project. Below are the key security features implemented to protect user data and maintain system integrity:

- **🛂 Authentication**
  - Verifies the identity of users before allowing access to protected endpoints.
  - Uses secure methods such as:
    - Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT)
    - Session authentication (if needed)
  - Ensures that only registered and verified users can interact with the system.

- **🔑 Authorization**
  - Grants permissions to users based on their roles and authentication status.
  - Ensures users can only perform actions they are allowed to (e.g., customers can't delete listings, managers can't alter admin data).
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to separate user capabilities.

- **📉 Rate Limiting**
  - Controls how frequently users can perform certain actions (e.g., submitting reviews or ratings).
  - Helps prevent abuse, spam, and system overload.
  - Limits are applied per user or per IP, depending on context.

Additional planned features:
- **🔒 Data Encryption** (for secure transmission)
- **🛡️ Input Validation & Sanitization** (to prevent injection attacks)
- **🚨 Security Logging & Alerts** (for monitoring suspicious activities)

These measures collectively ensure a robust and safe API environment for all platform users.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### Objective
To implement and understand how Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines enhance the software development lifecycle by automating testing, building, and deployment processes.

### What is a CI/CD Pipeline?

CI/CD pipelines are automated workflows that help streamline software development by:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
  - Automatically integrating and testing code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository.
  - Ensures that every code push is tested and verified, reducing integration issues and bugs.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
  - Automatically deploying verified code changes to staging or production environments.
  - Reduces manual intervention, speeds up release cycles, and ensures reliable delivery.

### Why It’s Important for This Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline provides several key benefits:

- Increases development efficiency and speed
- Catches bugs early through automated testing
- Reduces the risk of human error during deployments
- Makes collaboration and code merging smoother
- Supports consistent and reliable delivery to users

### Potential Tools & Technologies

Below are tools that can be integrated to create a functional CI/CD pipeline for this project:

- **GitHub Actions**  
  Automates workflows such as running tests, building the app, and deploying it to production directly from the GitHub repository.

- **Docker**  
  Containerizes the application to ensure consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.

- **Docker Compose**  
  Helps manage multi-container setups for running services like web app, database, etc.

- **Heroku / Render / AWS / DigitalOcean**  
  Platforms for hosting and deploying the application.

- **PostgreSQL**  
  Reliable database that can be integrated into the deployment pipeline for schema management and migrations.

- **pytest / unittest / Django Test Suite**  
  For running automated backend tests during the CI process.

In the future, the pipeline can be extended with features like:
- Code linting and style checks
- Notification integration (e.g., Slack alerts on failed builds)
- Rollback support on failed deployments
