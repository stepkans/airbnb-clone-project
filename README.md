## üè° Project Overview
*Welcome to my Airbnb Clone Project ‚Äî a comprehensive, real-world application I‚Äôm building to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project is a deep dive into full-stack development, where I‚Äôm focusing on core aspects such as backend systems, database design, RESTful API development, and application security.

*Through this hands-on experience, I aim to deepen my understanding of complex system architecture, user workflows, and team collaboration dynamics, all while working towards building a scalable and production-ready web application.

## Project Goals

- **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD** Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
